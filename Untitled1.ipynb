Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the loss function of a model, which encourages the model to generalize better to new data and reduces its tendency to overfit.Some common regularization techniques include:L1 regularization (Lasso): In L1 regularization, a penalty term is added to the loss function that is proportional to the absolute values of the model weights. This encourages the model to set some of the weights to zero, resulting in a sparse model that selects only the most important features. L1 regularization is commonly used for feature selection.L2 regularization (Ridge): In L2 regularization, a penalty term is added to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model weights. This encourages the model to spread the weight values more evenly across all the features, resulting in a smoother model that is less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization is commonly used for regression problems.Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out (i.e., sets to zero) some of the neurons in a neural network during training. This prevents the neurons from becoming too specialized to the training data and encourages the network to learn more robust features.Early stopping: Early stopping is a simple regularization technique that involves monitoring the performance of a model on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance on the validation set stops improving. This prevents the model from overfitting to the training data.Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that involves generating new training data by applying transformations (e.g., rotations, translations, scaling) to the existing training data. This increases the size and diversity of the training data, which can help prevent overfitting.These regularization techniques work by adding a penalty term to the loss function of a model, which discourages the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the training data. By using these techniques, we can develop models that generalize better to new data and are more robust to changes in the input data.'"
